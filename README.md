# 16-bit RISC CPU on FPGA (SystemVerilog)

A custom-designed 16-bit RISC processor built from scratch in SystemVerilog and deployed on an Intel DE2-115 FPGA.  
This project implements a complete ISA, datapath, control logic, and memory system, with full RTL verification and hardware execution.

##  Highlights
- Designed a custom MIPS-like 16-bit ISA
- Implemented full CPU datapath + FSM-based control unit
- Verified functionality using RTL simulation (ModelSim)
- Executed programs via instruction memory (.hex)
- Debugged using waveform analysis and signal tracing
- Successfully synthesized and deployed on FPGA hardware

A detailed technical report explaining the instruction set architecture (ISA), datapath design, control logic, verification strategy, and FPGA synthesis results is provided at the root of this repository.

## Repository Structure
### `source_files/`
Contains all **synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL modules** that define the hardware implementation of the CPU, including:
- Top-level CPU module
- Datapath and control unit
- ALU
- Register file
- Instruction memory (`imem.sv`)
- Data memory (`dmem.sv`)
- Program counter and supporting logic

These files collectively describe the complete 16-bit processor.

### `testbenches_and_program_instructions/`
Contains **RTL testbenches** and their corresponding **instruction memory `.hex` files** used for simulation and functional verification.

Each testbench targets a specific class of instructions, such as:
- R-type instructions
- I-type instructions
- Branch instructions
- Shift operations
- Call/return and control-flow instructions



For every testbench (`.sv`), there is a corresponding `.hex` file that contains the machine code program executed by the CPU during that specific simulation. Each testbench is designed to verify a particular instruction category, and its associated `.hex` file provides the instruction sequence required for that test.

## Instruction Memory and `.hex` File Usage

The instruction memory module (`imem.sv`) supports file-based initialization using `$readmemh`.  
A parameter in `imem.sv` is used to specify which `.hex` file should be loaded into instruction memory for simulation.

For each testbench, the `INIT_FILE` parameter in `imem.sv` must be set to the corresponding `.hex` file. For example, when running the call/return instruction testbench:

```systemverilog
parameter INIT_FILE = "tb_cpu_callret.hex";
```
